# Lock App

Lock is a basic password manager for iOS. It uses secure password encryption with P256 signing keys and an IV to encrypt data in a sqlite database. It also uses the same encryption method to support Time Based One Time Passcodes (TOTP) multi-factor authentication tools. Additionally, there are education tools on making secure passwords and multi-factor authentication.

## Running it
If you have a mac or ipad, you can download the project and run it in Swift Playgrounds / Xcode.
